# Changelog

## v1.0.0

First stable release.

### CLI

Eight commands with consistent semantics — all accept c4m files or directories interchangeably:

- `c4 id` — Identify files, directories, or c4m files
- `c4 cat` — Retrieve content by C4 ID from store
- `c4 diff` — Compare two states, produce patches
- `c4 patch` — Apply target state: reconcile directories, resolve patch chains
- `c4 merge` — Combine two or more filesystem trees
- `c4 log` — List patches in a chain
- `c4 split` — Split a patch chain at a given point
- `c4 version` — Print version

### c4m Format

Formally specified manifest format (SMPTE ST 2114:2017) for describing filesystem trees as plain text. Includes:

- Entry-only format with no directives — works natively with grep, awk, sort, diff
- Patch chains for incremental versioning
- Media file sequence notation (`frame.[0001-0100].exr`)
- Inline range data for self-contained c4m files
- Progressive resolution: structure, metadata, and full scan modes
- Universal Filename Encoding for arbitrary byte sequences in filenames
- Flow links for cross-location data relationships

### Content Store

Adaptive trie-sharded content store with atomic writes and configurable split threshold.

### Filesystem Reconciliation

`c4 patch` materializes c4m descriptions to real directories with:

- Pre-flight content availability check — never starts what it can't finish
- Idempotent operations — safe to re-run after interruption
- Move optimization — reuses content already present at different paths
- `-s` stores pre-patch state and removed content for reversal
- `-r` reverts to pre-patch state using stored manifest
- `--dry-run` previews changes without modifying the filesystem

### Platform Support

- macOS, Linux, Windows (amd64, arm64)
- Go 1.16+ minimum
- Zero external dependencies
