# Changelog

## v1.0.4

### New: Multi-target distribution

`reconcile.Distribute` reads a source directory once and writes to
multiple destinations simultaneously — directories, stores, or both.
Content is hashed during the single read pass. This is the library
primitive behind c4sh's multi-destination copy.

```go
result, err := reconcile.Distribute("/mnt/card/",
    reconcile.ToDir("/mnt/shuttle/"),
    reconcile.ToDir("/mnt/backup/"),
    reconcile.ToStore(myStore),
)
```

### Documentation

- Terminology cleanup: "c4m file" used consistently in user-facing docs
- Removed unqualified performance claims ("instant" → specific descriptions)

## v1.0.3

### New: Public scan package

The directory scanner is now a public package (`github.com/Avalanche-io/c4/scan`)
for use by ecosystem tools (c4sh, c4-mcp, etc.):

```go
m, err := scan.Dir("/path/to/dir")
m, err := scan.Dir("/path", scan.WithMode(scan.ModeFull))
```

### New: Quiet mode (`-q`)

`c4 id -q`, `c4 diff -q`, and `c4 patch -q` suppress stdout output
for commands run for their side effects (e.g., `c4 id -sq .` stores
content silently).

### Performance: Guided scan

`c4 diff` and `c4 patch` now use guided scanning when comparing a c4m
file against a directory. Only files with changed size or timestamp are
hashed — unchanged files reuse the C4 ID from the reference manifest.

### Bug fixes

- Directory timestamps now set correctly after reconciliation (deepest first)
- Existing directories get metadata updates, not just newly created ones
- Timestamp comparisons truncated to second precision at the c4m/filesystem
  boundary (prevents spurious diffs from sub-second differences)
- `isTerminal()` checks stdin, not stderr, for interactive prompts
- Store setup prompt appears before scanning, not after
- 12 code quality fixes: unchecked error returns on `Put()`, `Remove()`,
  `MkdirAll()`; TOCTOU race in content sourcing; `os.Lstat` for symlink
  safety; `filepath.Join` for Windows path construction

## v1.0.2

- `-q` (quiet) flag on `id`, `diff`, and `patch` for silent side-effect operations
- Directory metadata (timestamps, permissions) now set on existing directories during reconciliation
- Directory chtimes deferred to post-pass for both new and existing directories

## v1.0.1

- Guided scan optimization for `diff` and `patch` — only hashes files with changed metadata
- Timestamp precision fix at c4m/filesystem boundary (second vs nanosecond)
- Interactive prompt timing fix (before scan, not after)
- `isTerminal()` checks stdin instead of stderr

## v1.0.0

First stable release.

### CLI

Eight commands with consistent semantics — all accept c4m files or directories interchangeably:

- `c4 id` — Identify files, directories, or c4m files
- `c4 cat` — Retrieve content by C4 ID from store
- `c4 diff` — Compare two states, produce patches
- `c4 patch` — Apply target state: reconcile directories, resolve patch chains
- `c4 merge` — Combine two or more filesystem trees
- `c4 log` — List patches in a chain
- `c4 split` — Split a patch chain at a given point
- `c4 version` — Print version

### c4m Format

Formally specified manifest format (SMPTE ST 2114:2017) for describing filesystem trees as plain text. Includes:

- Entry-only format with no directives — works natively with grep, awk, sort, diff
- Patch chains for incremental versioning
- Media file sequence notation (`frame.[0001-0100].exr`)
- Inline range data for self-contained c4m files
- Progressive resolution: structure, metadata, and full scan modes
- Universal Filename Encoding for arbitrary byte sequences in filenames
- Flow links for cross-location data relationships

### Content Store

- Local: adaptive trie-sharded directory with atomic writes
- S3: any S3-compatible object store (AWS, MinIO, Backblaze, Wasabi, Ceph)
- Multi-store: write to first, read from all (`C4_STORE=a,b,c`)
- Zero external dependencies — S3 SigV4 signing implemented with stdlib

### Filesystem Reconciliation

`c4 patch` materializes c4m descriptions to real directories with:

- Pre-flight content availability check — never starts what it can't finish
- Idempotent operations — safe to re-run after interruption
- Move optimization — reuses content already present at different paths
- `-s` stores pre-patch state and removed content for reversal
- `-r` reverts to pre-patch state using stored manifest
- `--dry-run` previews changes without modifying the filesystem

### Platform Support

- macOS, Linux, Windows (amd64, arm64)
- Go 1.16+ minimum
- Zero external dependencies
