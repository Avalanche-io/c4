// package time provides a universal time representation, so that all users
// in all locations see identical values for identical moments in time.
// For this reason timezones are not differentiated, and UTC time is enforced
// for all operations.
//
// Time values can be converted to and from the standard library "time" package.
// Use the standard library package to convert to specific time zones for UI
// purposes.
